title: "Routing"
description: "In Lithe, you can define routes to control how your application responds to client requests using URIs (paths) and HTTP methods such as GET, POST, among others. Lithe offers flexibility and simplicity for defining and organizing your routes. Easily customize your application's behavior by connecting routes to specific functions or controllers to handle requests efficiently."
---

## Defining Routes

In Lithe, you define how the application responds to requests for endpoints using URIs and HTTP methods like GET and POST. Methods such as `get()`, `post()`, and `use()` are used to handle these requests and apply middleware. Each route can have one or more callback functions (handlers), which are executed when the route is matched. To pass control between functions, you need to use `$next()`, allowing multiple handlers to be used in sequence.
To define routes in Lithe, use the following structure:

```php
$app->METHOD($PATH, $HANDLER);
```

Where: 
    - `$app` is an instance of the `Lithe\App` class.
    - `METHOD` is the HTTP method (in lowercase) such as `get`, `post`, etc.
    - `$PATH` is the URL path that triggers the function.
    - `$HANDLER` is the function executed when the route is matched.

Here is a simple example of a route in Lithe:

```php {3,4,5}
$app = new \Lithe\App;

$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Hello World!');
});
```

In this example, we define a route that responds with "Hello World!" when a GET request is made to the home page.

---

### Route Methods

The route methods in Lithe are derived from HTTP methods and are attached to the instance of the `App` class. You can define routes for different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Here’s an example of how to define routes at the root of the application:

```php
$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Hello World!');
});

$app->post('/', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Got a POST request');
});

$app->put('/user', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Got a PUT request at /user');
});

$app->delete('/user', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Got a DELETE request at /user');
});
```

Lithe allows the registration of routes for any HTTP verb:

```php
$app->get($path, $handler);
$app->post($path, $handler);
$app->put($path, $handler);
$app->delete($path, $handler);
$app->patch($path, $handler);
$app->options($path, $handler);
$app->head($path, $handler);
```

If you need to register a route that responds to multiple HTTP verbs, use the `match` method or the `any` method to register a route that responds to all verbs.

```php
$app->match(['get', 'post'], '/', function ($req, $res) {
    // ...
});
 
$app->any('/', function ($req, $res) {
    // ...
});
```

---

## Defining Parameters in Routes

Route parameters are parts of the URL with specific names and are used to capture values. These captured values are placed in the `params` property of a `Request` instance, where each route parameter name becomes a key with its respective value.
```
Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
Request URL: http://localhost:8000/users/34/books/8989
$req->params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
```

### Simple Parameter
To define routes with route parameters, simply specify the route parameters in the route path as shown below.

```php
$app->get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->params);
});
```

> The names of route parameters should consist of “word characters” ([A-Za-z0-9_]).

### Typed Parameters

#### Defining Typed Parameters

You can define typed parameters to ensure that values meet specific criteria.

```php
$app->get('/user/:id=int', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->param('id'));
});
```

In the example above, the `id` parameter must be an integer (`int`). If the received request does not match the route pattern constraints, an HTTP 404 response will be returned.

Parameter data types are automatically converted behind the scenes, ensuring that the parameter value is of the specified type.

#### Using the `|` Operator for Optional Types

You can also use the `|` operator to define optional types in route parameters, allowing for different types or formats.

```php
$app->get('/user/:identifier=int|username', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->param('identifier'));
});
```

In the example above, `:identifier` can be an integer (`int`) or a username that matches (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16}`).

#### Parameters with Regular Expressions

To have more control over the exact string that can be matched by a route parameter, you can use regular expressions with the generic `regex` type.

```php
$app->get('/user/:name=regex<[a-z]+>', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->param('name'));
});
```

In this example, the `name` parameter must meet the regular expression `[a-z]+`, which matches a sequence of lowercase letters.

This approach provides greater flexibility and control in defining routes, ensuring that parameters meet specific criteria.

#### Parameter Types

Here is the equivalence of parameter types listed with their corresponding regular expressions:

- **int**: `[0-9]+` (one or more numeric digits)
- **string**: `[^/]+` (one or more characters that are not a slash `/`)
- **uuid**: `[a-f\d]{8}(-[a-f\d]{4}){4}[a-f\d]{8}` (UUID in standard format)
- **date**: `\d{4}\-\d{1,2}\-\d{1,2}` (date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **email**: `[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+` (valid email address)
- **bool**: `(false|true|0|1)` (boolean values: false, true, 0, or 1)
- **float**: `[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+` (floating-point number)
- **slug**: `[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*` (valid slug, used in URLs)
- **username**: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16}` (username with letters, numbers, and `_`, between 3 and 16 characters)
- **tel**: `\+?[\d\-\(\)]+` (phone number, optionally starting with `+` and containing digits, dashes, and parentheses)
- **alphanumeric**: `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` (alphanumeric string, letters and numbers)
- **regex\<Pattern\>**: Any valid regular expression you want to apply as a filter for the parameter. For example, `regex<(true|false)>` to accept only `true` or `false`.

These regular expressions are used to validate and capture parameters in routes, ensuring that they match the expected criteria. If a parameter does not match the specified pattern for its type, it may result in a 404 error.

## Route Handlers

You can provide multiple callback functions that act as middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks can invoke `$next()` to call the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to enforce preconditions on a route and then pass control to subsequent routes if there is no reason to continue with the current route.

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, a callable array, or combinations of both, as shown in the following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route. For example:

```php
$app->get('/example/a', function ($req, $res) {
  $res->send('Hello from A!');
});
```

More than one callback function can handle a route (be sure to specify `$next` as the third parameter and call it to invoke the next function in the [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)) of middleware or controller). For example:

```php
$app->get('/example/b', function ($req, $res, $next) {
  error_log('The response will be sent by the next function ...');
  $next();
}, function ($req, $res) {
  $res->send('Hello from B!');
});
```

A callable array can handle a route. For example:

```php
class UserController
{
    public static function index($req, $res) {
        return $res->view('users.index');
    }
}

$app->get('/user', [UserController::class, 'index']);
```

A combination of independent functions and callable arrays can handle a route. For example:

```php
$app->get('/user', function ($req, $res, $next) {
  error_log('The response will be sent by the next function ...');
  $next();
}, [UserController::class, 'index']);
```

---

## Chainable Route Handlers

You can also create chainable route handlers for a route path using the `route` method. Since the path is specified in a single place, creating modular routes is useful for reducing redundancies and typos. For more information on routes, refer to the [Router class documentation](/reference/lithe/router).

Here is an example of chainable route handlers defined using the `route` method:

```php
$app->route('/book')
  ->get(function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Get a random book');
  })
  ->post(function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Add a book');
  })
  ->put(function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Update the book');
  });
```

## Creating Modular Routers

The `Router` class in Lithe allows you to create modular and mountable route handlers. This provides a complete middleware and routing system, often referred to as a "mini-application." Let’s explore how to build and integrate a router into your application in a clear and organized manner.

### Router Structure

In this example, you will learn how to create a router as a separate module, configure middleware, define routes, and finally integrate the router module into your main application. This not only improves code organization but also facilitates maintenance and scalability.

    <TabsTrigger value="functional">Functional Syntax</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="classic">Classic Syntax</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="classic">
    The classic syntax for creating routers involves instantiating a router and defining routes that associate URIs with functions or controllers.
    <Stepper>
      <StepperItem title="Creating the Router File">
        Create a file named `birds.php` in your application directory. This file will be responsible for defining routes related to birds.
        ```php:src/birds.php
        <?php 
        // Instantiate the Router class
        $router = new \Lithe\Http\Router;

        // Middleware specific to this router
        $timeLog = function ($req, $res, $next) {
            echo 'Time: ' . date('Y-m-d');
            $next(); // Calls the next middleware or route
        };

        // Apply the middleware to the router
        $router->use($timeLog);

        // Define the home route
        $router->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
            $res->send('Birds homepage');
        });

        // Define the "About" route
        $router->get('/about', function ($req, $res) {
            $res->send('About the birds');
        });

        return $router; // Return the router for use in the main application
        ```

        - **Middleware**: The `$timeLog` middleware logs the current date on each request. The `$next()` function ensures that the next step of request processing is called, allowing the execution of the defined routes.
      </StepperItem>
      <StepperItem title="Integrating the Router in the Main Application">
        Now, you need to load the router module in the main application. Open the `src/App.php` file and add the following code:
        ```php:src/App.php
        // Load the bird router
        $birds = require(__DIR__ . '/birds.php');

        // Mount the router in the application at a specific path
        $app->use('/birds', $birds);
        ```

        - **Mounting**: The `$app->use('/birds', $birds)` function binds the loaded router to the `/birds` path of the application. This means all requests to this path will be managed by the defined router.
      </StepperItem>
    </Stepper>
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="functional">
    One way to structure your router is by using a functional approach, which can be more intuitive in some situations.
    - Each file is treated as a separate instance of the router, allowing you to organize your routes more intuitively.
    - With modularity, it's easier to add new routers or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the application.
    - Functions like `get` and `post` are specific to that file instance, which helps in reading and maintaining the code.
    
    <Stepper>
      <StepperItem title="Creating the Router File">
        Create a file named `birds.php` in your application directory. This file will be responsible for defining routes related to birds.
        ```php:src/birds.php 
        <?php
        use function Lithe\Orbis\Http\Router\{get, apply};

        // Middleware specific to this router
        $timeLog = function ($req, $res, $next) {
            echo 'Time: ' . date('Y-m-d');
            $next(); // Calls the next middleware or route
        };

        apply($timeLog); // Applies the middleware to the router

        // Define the home route
        get('/', function ($req, $res) {
            $res->send('Birds homepage');
        });

        // Define the "About" route
        get('/about', function ($req, $res) {
            $res->send('About the birds');
        });
        ```

        - Here, we use `apply($timeLog)` to apply the middleware, keeping the syntax simple and clear.
      </StepperItem>
      <StepperItem title="Integrating the Router in the Main Application">
        To integrate the router into your application, use the `router` function, which converts single files into routers ready to manage your routes simply and efficiently! Now, let's load the router module into the main application. Open the `src/App.php` file and add the following code:
        ```php
        // src/App.php

        use function Lithe\Orbis\Http\Router\{router};

        // Load the router from the 'birds.php' file
        $birds = router(__DIR__ . '/birds');

        // Mount the router in the application at the '/birds' route
        $app->use('/birds', $birds);
        ```

      </StepperItem>
    </Stepper>
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

Now, your application will be ready to handle requests to `/birds` and `/birds/about`, in addition to invoking the `$timeLog` middleware, which is specific to the router. A router can contain other routers, allowing for a hierarchical structure that better organizes the routes and functionalities of the application. Just like in the main application, routers are mounted in the same way, facilitating modularization and code maintenance. This promotes better scalability and clarity in organizing routes.

## Organizing Your Routes in a Modular and Automatic Way

The `set('routes', ...)` method simplifies route registration, making your code cleaner and more organized. With this method, you only need to structure your route folders and files, and the system will automatically handle the rest.

### How It Works

When you use `set('routes', ...)`, the system automatically locates and loads all PHP files within the specified folder (and subfolders). Routes are constructed based on the directory structure, and each file acts as a main router with its own path:

- If you have a **.php** file at the root of the routes directory (e.g., `.php`), it will create the `/` route.
- If you have a **.php** file within a folder, such as `cart/.php`, it will create the `/cart` route.
- Files located within the same folder as the main router will be mounted to it, forming sub-routes. For example, if there is a `dest.php` file inside `cart/`, it will be integrated into the `cart/.php` router, creating the `/cart/dest` route.
- Similarly, if there is a subfolder such as `cart/dest/` containing a **.php** file (or other files), it will be mounted as a router for the `/cart/dest` route, and all files inside will be integrated into this router.

With this approach, the middlewares and configurations defined in the main router of each directory will automatically apply to all child routes.

### Configuration

#### Directory Structure:

```
/routes
    .php              // Main router for the application (route "/")
    checkout.php
    /cart
        .php          // Main router for the "/cart" module
        dest.php      // Mounted on the /cart router (route "/cart/dest")
        other.php     // Mounted on the /cart router (route "/cart/other")
    /admin
        dashboard.php // Creates the route "/admin/dashboard"
        users.php     // Mounted on the router for /admin/users
```

#### Defining Routes in Files:

In each file, you can define your routes using the style of your choice, either **functional syntax** or **classic syntax**.

**File `.php` (at the root of `/routes`):**

```php
$router->get('/', function ($req, $res) { 
  $res->send('Welcome to the application!');
});
```

**File `checkout.php`:**

```php
$router->get('/', function ($req, $res) { 
  $res->send('Checkout Page'); 
});
```

**File `.php` inside `/cart` (routes/cart/.php):**

```php
$router->get('/', function ($req, $res) { 
  $res->send('Cart Page'); 
});

// Middlewares applied to all routes within the /cart module
$router->use(function ($req, $res, $next) {
  // Verification or authentication logic
  $next();
});
```

**File `dest.php` inside `/cart`:**

```php
$router->get('/', function ($req, $res) { 
  $res->send('Cart Details');
});
```

**File `admin/dashboard.php`:**

```php
$router->get('/', function ($req, $res) { 
  $res->send('Admin Dashboard'); 
});
```

---

This approach allows the system to:
- Automatically locate and load all PHP router files in the routes folder and subfolders.
- Map routers hierarchically so that **.php** files in each directory act as the main routers.
- Mount files and subfolders as sub-routes for the main routers, ensuring that middlewares defined in these routers apply to all child routes.

By following this convention, you can structure your folders and files, and the system will automatically assemble the routes, keeping your code cleaner, more modular, and well-organized.

### Application Configuration

To define the path for your routes and enable automatic loading, just add the following configuration in your application:

```php
$app->set('routes', __DIR__ . '/routes');  // Defines the path and automatically loads routes
```

The directory structure makes it easier to visualize and maintain routes. Just organize your folders and files, and let the system manage the paths.
