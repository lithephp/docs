## Creating Models

In Lithe, models are created using the Line `make:model` command. This command creates a model file inside the `src/models/` directory.

```bash
php line make:model ModelName --template=eloquent
```

**Where:**
- **`ModelName`**: The name of the model to be created.
- **`--template=Template`**: Optional. Defines the template to be used for generating the model. If not specified, the template defined in the `DB_CONNECTION_METHOD` environment variable will be used.

### Model Templates

Lithe supports different templates for models, adapted for various ORMs or database approaches:

- **eloquent**: Template for models using the Eloquent ORM.
- **plain**: Default template for custom or generic models.

### Model File (Eloquent)

When creating a model using the Eloquent template, you can follow this basic example for a user model:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'users';

    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email',
    ];

    // Your model logic goes here
}
```

### Model File (Plain)

For models without a specific ORM, you can use the plain template and implement the model logic as needed:

```php
namespace App\Models;

class User
{
    public $id;
    public $name;
    public $email;

    // Your model logic goes here
}
```

## Automatic Model Usage

In Lithe, models located in `src/models` are automatically available for use throughout the application without the need for explicit imports in your files.

Suppose you have an Eloquent model `User` defined in `src/models/User.php`. You can use it directly in your routes without any manual inclusion:

```php
use App\Models\User;

$app->get('/users/:id=int', function ($req, $res) {
    $params = $req->params;
    $id = $params->id;

    // Example of using the User model with Eloquent
    $user = User::find($id);

    if (!$user) {
        return $res->status(404)
            ->json(['error' => 'User not found']);
    }

    // Return user data as JSON, for example
    return $res->json($user);
});
```

In this way, models are loaded dynamically and are ready to be used in your routes, providing a simplified and efficient integration with the database.

Models in Lithe are essential for organizing and interacting with the application's data, offering flexibility and abstraction for working with different ORMs or database logics.
