title: "Routing"
description: "In Lithe, you can define routes to control how your application responds to client requests using URIs (paths) and HTTP methods such as GET, POST, among others. Lithe offers flexibility and simplicity for defining and organizing your routes. Easily customize your application's behavior by connecting routes to specific functions or controllers to handle requests efficiently."
---

## Defining Routes

In Lithe, you define how the application responds to requests for endpoints using URIs and HTTP methods like GET and POST. Methods such as `get()`, `post()`, and `use()` are used to handle these requests and apply middleware. Each route can have one or more callback functions (handlers), which are executed when the route is matched. To pass control between functions, you need to use `$next()`, allowing multiple handlers to be used in sequence.
To define routes in Lithe, use the following structure:

```php
$app->METHOD($PATH, $HANDLER);
```

Where: 
    - `$app` is an instance of the `Lithe\App` class.
    - `METHOD` is the HTTP method (in lowercase) such as `get`, `post`, etc.
    - `$PATH` is the URL path that triggers the function.
    - `$HANDLER` is the function executed when the route is matched.

Here is a simple example of a route in Lithe:

```php {3,4,5}
$app = new \Lithe\App;

$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Hello World!');
});
```

In this example, we define a route that responds with "Hello World!" when a GET request is made to the home page.

---

## Route Methods

A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods and is attached to an instance of the Lithe `App` class.

The following code is an example of routes defined at the root of the application.

```php
// Defining a GET route
$app->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Hello World!');
});

// Defining a POST route
$app->post('/', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Got a POST request');
});

// Defining a PUT route
$app->put('/user', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Got a PUT request at /user');
});

// Defining a DELETE route
$app->delete('/user', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->send('Got a DELETE request at /user');
});
```

In this example, we define routes for HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Each route has a specific path (`$PATH`) and a handler (`$HANDLER`), which is a function that receives a request (`Request`) and a response (`Response`).

### Available Route Methods

Lithe allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

```php
$app->get($path, $handler);
$app->post($path, $handler);
$app->put($path, $handler);
$app->delete($path, $handler);
$app->patch($path, $handler);
$app->options($path, $handler);
$app->head($path, $handler);
```

Sometimes you may need to register a route that responds to multiple HTTP verbs. You can do this using the `match` method. Or, you can even register a route that responds to all HTTP verbs using the `any` method:

```php
$app->match(['get', 'post'], '/', function ($req, $res) {
    // ...
});
 
$app->any('/', function ($req, $res) {
    // ...
});
```

---

## Defining Parameters in Routes

Route parameters are parts of the URL with specific names and are used to capture values. These captured values are placed in the `params` property of a `Request` instance, where each route parameter name becomes a key with its respective value.
```
Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
Request URL: http://localhost:8000/users/34/books/8989
$req->params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
```

### Simple Parameter
To define routes with route parameters, simply specify the route parameters in the route path as shown below.

```php
$app->get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->params);
});
```

> The names of route parameters should consist of “word characters” ([A-Za-z0-9_]).

### Typed Parameters

#### Defining Typed Parameters

You can define typed parameters to ensure that values meet specific criteria.

```php
$app->get('/user/:id=int', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->param('id'));
});
```

In the example above, the `id` parameter must be an integer (`int`). If the received request does not match the route pattern constraints, an HTTP 404 response will be returned.

Parameter data types are automatically converted behind the scenes, ensuring that the parameter value is of the specified type.

#### Using the `|` Operator for Optional Types

You can also use the `|` operator to define optional types in route parameters, allowing for different types or formats.

```php
$app->get('/user/:identifier=int|username', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->param('identifier'));
});
```

In the example above, `:identifier` can be an integer (`int`) or a username that matches (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16}`).

#### Parameters with Regular Expressions

To have more control over the exact string that can be matched by a route parameter, you can use regular expressions with the generic `regex` type.

```php
$app->get('/user/:name=regex<[a-z]+>', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send($req->param('name'));
});
```

In this example, the `name` parameter must meet the regular expression `[a-z]+`, which matches a sequence of lowercase letters.

This approach provides greater flexibility and control in defining routes, ensuring that parameters meet specific criteria.

#### Parameter Types

Here is the equivalence of parameter types listed with their corresponding regular expressions:

- **int**: `[0-9]+` (one or more numeric digits)
- **string**: `[^/]+` (one or more characters that are not a slash `/`)
- **uuid**: `[a-f\d]{8}(-[a-f\d]{4}){4}[a-f\d]{8}` (UUID in standard format)
- **date**: `\d{4}\-\d{1,2}\-\d{1,2}` (date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **email**: `[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+` (valid email address)
- **bool**: `(false|true|0|1)` (boolean values: false, true, 0, or 1)
- **float**: `[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+` (floating-point number)
- **slug**: `[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*` (valid slug, used in URLs)
- **username**: `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16}` (username with letters, numbers, and `_`, between 3 and 16 characters)
- **tel**: `\+?[\d\-\(\)]+` (phone number, optionally starting with `+` and containing digits, dashes, and parentheses)
- **alphanumeric**: `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` (alphanumeric string, letters and numbers)
- **regex\<Pattern\>**: Any valid regular expression you want to apply as a filter for the parameter. For example, `regex<(true|false)>` to accept only `true` or `false`.

These regular expressions are used to validate and capture parameters in routes, ensuring that they match the expected criteria. If a parameter does not match the specified pattern for its type, it may result in a 404 error.

## Route Handlers

You can provide multiple callback functions that act as middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks can invoke `$next()` to call the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to enforce preconditions on a route and then pass control to subsequent routes if there is no reason to continue with the current route.

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, a callable array, or combinations of both, as shown in the following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route. For example:

```php
$app->get('/example/a', function ($req, $res) {
  $res->send('Hello from A!');
});
```

More than one callback function can handle a route (be sure to specify `$next` as the third parameter and call it to invoke the next function in the [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)) of middleware or controller). For example:

```php
$app->get('/example/b', function ($req, $res, $next) {
  error_log('The response will be sent by the next function ...');
  $next();
}, function ($req, $res) {
  $res->send('Hello from B!');
});
```

A callable array can handle a route. For example:

```php
class UserController
{
    public static function index($req, $res) {
        return $res->view('users.index');
    }
}

$app->get('/user', [UserController::class, 'index']);
```

A combination of independent functions and callable arrays can handle a route. For example:

```php
$app->get('/user', function ($req, $res, $next) {
  error_log('The response will be sent by the next function ...');
  $next();
}, [UserController::class, 'index']);
```

---

## Chainable Route Handlers

You can also create chainable route handlers for a route path using the `route` method. Since the path is specified in a single place, creating modular routes is useful for reducing redundancies and typos. For more information on routes, refer to the [Router class documentation](/reference/lithe/router).

Here is an example of chainable route handlers defined using the `route` method:

```php
$app->route('/book')
  ->get(function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Get a random book');
  })
  ->post(function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Add a book');
  })
  ->put(function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Update the book');
  });
```

## Creating Modular Routers

The `Router` class in Lithe allows you to create modular and mountable route handlers. This provides a complete middleware and routing system, often referred to as a "mini-application." Let’s explore how to build and integrate a router into your application in a clear and organized manner.

### Router Structure

In this example, you will learn how to create a router as a separate module, configure middleware, define routes, and finally integrate the router module into your main application. This not only improves code organization but also facilitates maintenance and scalability.

### Classic Syntax

#### 1. Creating the Router File

Create a file named `birds.php` in your application's directory. This file will be responsible for defining routes related to birds.

```php:src/birds.php
<?php 

// Instantiate the Router class
$router = new \Lithe\Http\Router;

// Middleware specific to this router
$timeLog = function ($req, $res, $next) {
    echo 'Time: ' . date('Y-m-d');
    $next(); // Calls the next middleware or route
};

// Apply the middleware to the router
$router->use($timeLog);

// Define the homepage route
$router->get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Birds Homepage');
});

// Define the "About" route
$router->get('/about', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('About Birds');
});

return $router; // Returns the router for use in the main application
```

- **Middleware**: The `$timeLog` middleware logs the current date for each request. The `$next()` function ensures that the next step in the request processing is called, allowing the execution of the defined routes.

#### 2. Integrating the Router into the Main Application

Now you need to load the router module into the main application. Open the `App.php` file and add the following code:

```php:src/App.php
$birds = require(__DIR__ . '/birds.php'); // Loads the birds router

// Mount the router in the application at a specific path
$app->use('/birds', $birds);
```

- **Mounting**: The `$app->use('/birds', $birds)` function binds the loaded router to the `/birds` path of the application. This means that all requests to this path will be handled by the defined router.

### Functional Syntax

Another way to structure your router is by using a functional approach, which can be more intuitive in some situations.

- Each file is treated as a separate instance of the router, allowing you to organize your routes more intuitively.
- With modularity, it’s easier to add new routers or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the application.
- Functions like `get` and `post` are specific to that file instance, aiding in code readability and maintenance.

#### 1. Creating the Router File

Create the `birds.php` file, but this time using a functional syntax:

```php:src/birds.php 
<?php
use function Lithe\Orbis\Http\Router\{get, apply};

// Middleware specific to this router
$timeLog = function ($req, $res, $next) {
    echo 'Time: ' . date('Y-m-d');
    $next(); // Calls the next middleware or route
};

apply($timeLog); // Applies the middleware to the router

// Define the homepage route
get('/', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Birds Homepage');
});

// Define the "About" route
get('/about', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('About Birds');
});
```

- Here, we use `apply($timeLog)` to apply the middleware while keeping the syntax simple and clear.

#### 2. Integrating the Router into the Main Application

As before, you need to load the router into the application:

```php:src/App.php
use function Lithe\Orbis\Http\Router\{router};

$birds = router(__DIR__ . '/birds'); // Loads the router

// Mount the router in the application
$app->use('/birds', $birds);
```

Now, your application will be ready to handle requests for `/birds` and `/birds/about`, as well as invoke the `$timeLog` middleware, which is specific to the router.
