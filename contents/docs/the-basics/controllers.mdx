## Writing Controllers

### Basic Controllers

To quickly generate a new controller, you can run the `make:controller` command. By default, all controllers generated by this command are stored in the `src/http/controllers` directory:

```bash
php line make:controller UserController
```

A controller can have any number of public methods that will respond to incoming HTTP requests:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\User;

class UserController
{
    /**
     * Show the profile of a specific user.
     */
    public function show($req)
    {
        $id = $req->param('id');
        
        return view('user.profile', [
            'user' => User::findOrFail($id)
        ]);
    }
}
```

After writing a controller class and its method, you can define a route for the controller method as follows:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;
 
$app->get('/user/:id', [UserController::class, 'show']);
```

When an incoming request matches the specified route URI, the `show` method of the `App\Http\Controllers\UserController` class will be invoked, and the route parameters will be passed to the method.

## Middleware in Controllers

Middlewares can also be defined directly in controllers to apply pre-processing or post-processing logic to all routes or to a specific group of routes. This allows you to centralize the middleware logic directly within the controller structure.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class UserController
{
    // ... Other methods

    /**
     * Middleware to check authentication.
     */
    public function loggedIn($req, $res, $next)
    {
        $authenticated = false; // Your authentication logic

        if (!$authenticated) {
            $res->redirect('/login');
        }

        $next();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `loggedIn` method acts as middleware to check authentication before any route is executed. This ensures that only authenticated users can access routes that use this middleware.

After writing your middleware, you can apply it to a route as follows:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

$loggedIn = [UserController::class, 'loggedIn'];
 
$app->get('/user/:id', $loggedIn, [UserController::class, 'show']);
```

This ensures that the `loggedIn` middleware is executed before the `show` method is called for any request on the `/user/:id` route.
