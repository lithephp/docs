## What is Lithe?

**Lithe** is a lightweight and flexible PHP framework designed to provide fast request and response handling. It allows users to load only the essential components, avoiding unnecessary overhead and improving application performance. With a modular structure, Lithe offers the customization needed for developers to integrate specific functionalities, resulting in agile and responsive applications that ensure a superior user experience.

See how simple it is to create a route that fetches a user by ID:

```php
get('/users/:id', function ($req, $res) {
    $id = $req->param('id');
    $user = User::find($id);
    
    if (!$user) {
        return $res->status(404)->json([
            'error' => 'User not found'
        ]);
    } 

    return $res->view('profile', compact('user'));
});
```

In this example, when accessing the route `/users/:id`, Lithe retrieves the corresponding user and displays their profile. If the user is not found, a 404 error is returned, demonstrating the robustness of the framework.

## Simple and Flexible Routing

**With Lithe, defining routes is as easy as breathing!** Use functions like `get()`, `post()`, among others, to create routes that respond to different types of HTTP requests in an intuitive and expressive manner:

```php
get('/hello/:name', function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Hello, ' . $req->param('name'));
});
```

## Powerful Middleware

**Imagine having a robust line of defense in your applications!** In Lithe, middleware allows you to inspect, filter, and manipulate HTTP requests before they reach their final routes. This means you can add functionalities like authentication and logging in a **modular and reusable** way.

Here's how easy it is to define and use a middleware:

```php
// Middleware to check if the token is valid
$EnsureTokenIsValid = function ($req, $res, $next) {
    $token = $req->param('token');

    if ($token !== 'my-secret-token') {
        return $res->send('Invalid token.');
    }

    $next();
};

// Protected route using the middleware
get('/protected/:token', $EnsureTokenIsValid, function ($req, $res) {
    $res->send('Protected content accessed successfully!');
});
```

## Database Integration

**Connect to your data effortlessly!** Lithe supports popular ORMs like Eloquent and native PHP drivers such as MySQLi and PDO. Configure your connections in the `.env` file and manage schema migrations with ease.

```

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=lithe
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_SHOULD_INITIATE=true
```

## Database Migrations

**Maintain data consistency and integrity in your applications with automated migrations!** With Lithe, creating and applying migrations is quick and easy, using any ORM or database driver interface.

```bash
php line make:migration CreateUsersTable --template=eloquent
php line migrate
```
